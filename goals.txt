# Locality

# 1 Fitted shapes are disfigured due to vertices
# moving far away from their neighborhood.

# 2 Hierachy of resolutions
# Higher resolutions shouldn't be far away from lower resolutions
# Something like Matrioska dolls.

# 3 Self intersection between surfaces
# Maybe use repulsive surfaces

# END GOAL!!!

# Find energies that makes the mesh smooth. 
# 1 Smoothness
# Vertices on the grid should be close
# 2 No self intersections
# Surface should not intersect itself
